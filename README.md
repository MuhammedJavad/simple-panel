Simple Panel" is a clean .NET project structure that can help you create a back-office panel from scratch. As a back-end engineer, I have had to deal with back-office projects almost everywhere in my career. Building simple back-office panels can be a daunting task when time is limited and it's required to keep the code clean. This project snippet could be helpful for back-office projects. It's based on DDD, Clean Architecture, Dapper, Entity Framework, and Blazor as its presentation layer.
